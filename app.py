DESCRIPTION = """
A highly motivated Computer Science student at HUST with a strong foundation in software development, data structures, and algorithms. I am eager to apply my technical skills in real-world projects, with a specific interest in computer vision and machine learning. My short-term goal is to gain hands-on experience in advanced research areas such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), facial recognition, and object classification and detection. In the long term, I aspire to develop a deep expertise in computer vision, translating theoretical knowledge into impactful applications that drive innovation and address real-world challenges.
